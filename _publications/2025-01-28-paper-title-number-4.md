Predicting road freight prices is a challenging task influenced by multiple factors. Understanding which variables have the greatest impact is essential for building more accurate models, and consequently for enhancing the competitiveness of Brazilian soybeans in the global market. This study aims to evaluate the influence of different exogenous variables on soybean freight prices and to analyze how this influence varies across different distance ranges. To achieve this, a combination of machine learning techniques was applied to a comprehensive dataset containing information on freight costs, regional characteristics, production, fuel prices, storage, and commercialization. The results indicate that distance is the most significant variable in determining freight costs, directly reflecting operational expenses such as fuel consumption and labor costs. Additionally, macroeconomic factors such as the exchange rate and export volume play a crucial role, highlighting the global context of Brazilâ€™s soybean exports. Stratified analysis by distance ranges reveals distinct patterns; short-distance freight is predominantly related to domestic markets, while medium- and long-distance freight are strongly linked to export logistics.
