This theoretical-practical short course presents the principles, applications, main chal-lenges, and trends in electric mobility and smart charging with NFT (Non-Fungible To-ken).   In the theoretical part of the short course,  the main challenges and motivationsrelated to electric mobility and dynamic pricing for the use of blockchain and NFT areaddressed.  The main concepts about NFT and its commercial applications, such as ga-mes, health, artistic productions, and certificates, are described. Specific applications inelectric mobility and dynamic pricing, such as carbon credit management, are detailed,highlighting how NFTs allow the management of device identities, the generation of bil-ling tokens, and the recording of activities in a secure, private, and legal way.  The mainresearch challenges in this area, such as anonymization and the high number of transac-tions, will be discussed in detail. Finally, to bring practical knowledge on the subject, wepresent a hands-on for issuing NFTs with the participants of the short course.</div>
