<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am thrilled to share that Iâ€™ve recently been approved in a public selection process for the Computer Theory area! This marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter in my academic career. However, it also means saying goodbye to my time as a professor at UERJ (Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro).

Teaching at UERJ has been an incredibly rewarding experience, and I will deeply miss the amazing students and colleagues I had the privilege of working with. While I look forward to this new journey, UERJ will always hold a special place in my heart.
